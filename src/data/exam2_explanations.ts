    S1: `Pocket the balls in numerical order. No scratch or contact with remaining balls. If you disturb another ball while pocketing, the run ends. Shoot the drill twice and use the higher score of the two attempts. Score = number of balls pocketed legally before a miss or contact (max 4).`,
    S2: `Do the drill twice and use the higher score. No scratching, combinations, or disturbing remaining balls. Score = number of balls pocketed legally before a miss or contact (max 7).`,
    S3: `Attempt and score three layouts; add the two lowest scores. 1 point for each ball pocketed legally under 9‑ball rotation rules (always hit the lowest‑numbered ball first). If the 9‑ball is pocketed early you must still pocket the remaining balls.`,
    S4: `Attempt and score three layouts; add the two lowest scores. 1 point for each ball pocketed legally before a miss. Obstacle balls may be contacted.`,
    S5: `Take two attempts from each CB position; 1 point for each successful snooker where the OB is hidden from the CB with no direct path of contact. The 1 ball may not be pocketed. The obstacle cluster may be contacted but must remain within/overlapping the target.`,
    S6: `Kick at each OB off the same long rail with the CB in the same starting position; 1 point for each successful and legal shot (no scratch, ball to rail).`,
    S7: `With CB in hand for each shot, bank each ball cross side; 1 point for each bank pocketed legally (no scratch).`,
    S8: `Pocket each OB from the indicated CB position without scratching; 1 point for each successful shot.`,
    S9: `Jump or massé: 3 attempts; 1 point for each successful shot (OB pocketed, no obstacle‑ball contact). You are allowed to scratch.`,
    S10: `Break three times and score each break (points for no scratch; CB not driven to a cushion; CB stays within center target; 1+ balls pocketed; 3+ OBs pocketed or driven above head string). Throw out best and worst; score = median (middle value).`,

    S3: `Attempt and score three layouts; add the two lowest scores. Additional requirement on Layout 3: get shape on the 7 and 9 by going off three or four rails from the 6 and 8; if you don’t, the run stops but you get credit if the 6 or 8 is pocketed.`,
